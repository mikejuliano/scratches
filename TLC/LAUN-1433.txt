We are simplifying the data model to the below.
Code will need refactored to handle this.
This is also for cleaning up technical debt around 'bins'.

Schedule: {
	Id: null,
	Types: [ ],
	HoursOfOperation: [ ],
	SpecialDays: [ ],

	//This is new
	AppliesTo: [
		{
			Item: { // SimpleInstance
			    Id: '2002-A',
            	Model: Unit | Location | Future?
            	Display: 'Behind Coffee Station'
			},
            Meta: {
                LocationName: 'Sutherland',
                LocationId: '123,
                ClientId: 'pitt_id'
		    }
		}
	],
	Configuration: { SchedulingBlackoutHours: null, AdvanceSchedulingDays: null }
}

Location is now greatly simplified, and likely not needed much at runtime.

Location: {
	Id: null,
	Name: null,
	Types: [ ],
	Coordinates: { Longitude: null, Latitude: null },
	Address: { Label: null, IsDefault: false, LineOne: null, LineTwo: null, City: null, State: { Abbreviation: null, Name: null }, Zipcode: null },

	// Going away (replaced with concepts in other data)
	x SpecialInstructions: null,
	x Bags: [ ],
	x Bins: [ ],
	x Schedules: [ ],
	x Configuration: { SchedulingBlackoutHours: null, AdvanceSchedulingDays: null }
}

Not much changes on the Unit side, some removal of fields

Unit: {
	Id: null,
	Name: null,
	// Remove unit name and unit id, just use name / id.
	    I believe this was carried over from CleanCube - some values needed in their system and not ours
	x UnitName: null,
	x UnitId: null,
	MaxHeight: null,
	MaxWidth: null,
	Status: {
		Name: null,
		Label: null,
		Description: null,
		IsActive: false,
		ActionsByRole: [ ],
		Messages: {
			Default: {
				Key: null,
				Value: [ ]
			}
		}
	},
	Lockers: [ ],
	Location: { Id: null, Display: null, Model: null }
}


UsedScheduleSlot Model Change
UsedScheduleSlot.Items
is defined as a string[] in the model, but the data is all number[].  Weâ€™ll need a data cleanup task for this.



getAvailableTimeSlots
scheduleTimeSlot


isFull ?
are bins completely gone?
